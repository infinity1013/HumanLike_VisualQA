Recent studies on machine reading comprehension have focused on text-level understanding but have not yet reached the level of human understanding of the visual layout and content of real-world documents.

Creating intelligent agents that can answer questions as well as people can is a long-cherished goal of artificial intelligence. To achieve this goal, machine reading comprehension(MRC), a challenge to enable a machine to read and comprehend natural language texts so that it can answer questions. The MRC capability can be of value to users if it can be employed by automated assistants such as customer-service chatbots on e-commerce websites or assistant systems for reading professional literature. Here, most real-world documents are provided in non-plain text formats (e.g., HTML and PDF). However, current studies in MRC almost exclusively focus on text-level understanding, while neglecting the visual layout and content (text appearance, tables, charts, etc.) of the documents.
