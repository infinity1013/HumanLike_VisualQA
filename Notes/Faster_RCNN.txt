An RPN(Region Proposal Network) is a fully convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. The RPN is trained end-to-end to generate high-quality region proposals, which are used by Fast R-CNN for detection. We merge RPN and Fast R-CNN into a single network by sharing their convolutional features

Selective Search greedily merges superpixels based on engineered low-level features.

convolutional feature maps used by region-based detectors, like Fast RCNN, can also be used for generating region proposals. On top of these convolutional features, we construct an RPN by adding a few additional convolutional layers that simultaneously regress region bounds and objectness scores at each location on a regular grid. The RPN is thus a kind of fully convolutional network (FCN) and can be trained end-to-end specifically for the task for generating detection proposals.

object proposal methods include those based on grouping super-pixels (e.g.Selective Search, CPMC, MCG) and those based on sliding windows (e.g. objectness in windows, EdgeBoxes). 

The R-CNN method trains CNNs end-to-end to classify the proposal regions into object categories or background. 
R-CNN mainly plays as a classifier, and it does not predict object bounds (except for refining by bounding box regression). Its accuracy depends on the performance of the region proposal module
